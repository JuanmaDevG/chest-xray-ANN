# Developing ANN (Artificial Neural Networks)

This project was a college assignment and I decided to upload my progress in it, 
don't expect it to work on edge cases.

This project is about detecting pneumonia (positive or negative) by having an
input of xray images. This will be done by building an Artificial Neural Network
using keras and python.
